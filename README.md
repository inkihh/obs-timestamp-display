# Permanent visible timestamp

For documentation reasons, you may want to display a dynamic timestamp in your OBS video permanently. I haven't found a way to do this, so here's one.

* Save timestamp.html somewhere on your local drive
* Create a new Browser source in OBS
* As URL, paste the path to that file, C:\Users\inkihh\Documents\Github\obs-timestamp-display\run.html in my case
* Set Width to 200 and Height to 25. You can alter these later, if they don't fit your environment
* Put it in a corner
* Done!
